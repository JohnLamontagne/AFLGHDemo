## Linked Files

As you can see, MD files can link to other MD files, allowing for additional organization of information as necessary. 

You can link directly to any page or file, both within or outside of the repository, via the hyperlink markdown:
```
[Like this](www.yourlink.com)
```


For example, we can provide a link back to our root MD file via an imbedded hyperlink:
[Return to repository root](https://github.com/JohnLamontagne/AFLGHDemo)
